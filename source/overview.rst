Overview
#############

ROBOTONT is an mobile ground robot with omnidirectional wheels to enable rapid movement in any direction at a desired heading. 
The sensor system includes a depth camera which allows it to see like humans and map the entire environment in 3D. 
The powerful on-board computer facilitates running high performance algorithms and libraries. 
The software stack is open-source and based on ROS (Robot Operating System). 
Its literally transparent design, modular hardware, and open-source software offer endeless custiomization and extendibility options.

ROBOTONT currently includes the following out-of-the-box demos:

    
   * Android device, gamepad and keyboard based teleoperation,
   * 2D mapping and SLAM,
   * 3D mapping,
   * AR marker tracking, and
   * gesture-based human-robot interaction.
